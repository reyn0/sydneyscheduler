# Google Analytics Integration Guide

This guide explains how to set up Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking for your Sydney Roster Scheduler application.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Google Analytics Account
1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Start measuring"
4. Create a new account (e.g., "Sydney Scheduler")
5. Create a new property (e.g., "sydneyscheduler.com")
6. Choose "Web" as the platform
7. Enter your website URL: `https://sydneyscheduler.com`

### Step 2: Get Your Measurement ID
1. In GA4 dashboard, go to **Admin** (gear icon)
2. Under **Property**, click **Data Streams**
3. Click on your web stream
4. Copy the **Measurement ID** (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 3: Configure Your Application
1. Open `frontend/.env` file
2. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR-ACTUAL-ID
   ```

### Step 4: Test Locally
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
2. Open browser console and check for "Google Analytics initialized" message
3. The app should start without import errors

### Step 5: Deploy and Verify
1. Rebuild your frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Copy the build to your server:
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r build/* /srv/sydneyscheduler/frontend/build/
   ```
3. Visit your site and check Google Analytics Real-time reports

## üìä What Gets Tracked

The integration automatically tracks:

### Page Views
- Home page visits (`/`)
- Scrape starter page visits (`/start`)
- URL changes and navigation

### User Interactions
- **Search queries**: When users search the roster tables
- **Column sorting**: When users click column headers to sort
- **Filter actions**: When users clear filters or reset to original order
- **Roster tab changes**: When users switch between Today/Tomorrow tabs
- **Site interactions**: When users view different venue rosters
- **Scrape requests**: When users manually trigger scraping
- **Support clicks**: When users click "Buy me a coffee"

### Custom Events Tracked
- `roster_view`: Which site/day combination users view most
- `search`: What terms users search for
- `sort`: How users prefer to sort the data
- `scrape_request`: Manual scraping frequency
- `click`: Support button interactions
- `filter`: Filter usage patterns

## üéØ Analytics Benefits

### User Behavior Insights
- **Most popular sites**: Which venues get the most views
- **Search patterns**: What users are looking for
- **Usage times**: When your site is most active
- **Mobile vs Desktop**: Device usage breakdown

### Performance Metrics
- **Page load times**: How fast your site loads
- **Bounce rate**: User engagement levels
- **Session duration**: How long users stay
- **Return visitors**: User retention rates

### Business Intelligence
- **Traffic sources**: Where users come from
- **Geographic data**: Where your users are located
- **Popular content**: Which features are used most
- **Conversion tracking**: Support button click rates

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production
REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR-PRODUCTION-ID

# Staging (optional)
REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR-STAGING-ID
```

### Privacy Considerations
The current setup:
- ‚úÖ Respects user privacy
- ‚úÖ No personal data collection
- ‚úÖ Anonymous usage tracking only
- ‚úÖ Complies with basic privacy standards

For GDPR compliance, consider adding:
- Cookie consent banner
- Privacy policy page
- User opt-out functionality

### Testing Analytics
1. **Real-time reports**: Check GA4 Real-time section
2. **Browser console**: Look for analytics initialization messages
3. **GA4 DebugView**: Enable debug mode for detailed event tracking
4. **Chrome extension**: Use Google Analytics Debugger extension

**Testing in Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Test if analytics is working
console.log('dataLayer exists:', typeof window.dataLayer !== 'undefined');
console.log('gtag function exists:', typeof window.gtag !== 'undefined');

// Test custom event
if (typeof window.gtag === 'function') {
  window.gtag('event', 'test_event', {
    event_category: 'Test',
    event_label: 'Console_Test'
  });
  console.log('Test event sent');
}
```

**Best Practice**: Delete any test files after debugging to keep the codebase clean.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Analytics not working:**
- Check Measurement ID is correct in `.env`
- Verify the site is rebuilt after changing `.env`
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure site is accessible via HTTPS

**Events not tracking:**
- Verify analytics initialization in browser console
- Check if ad blockers are interfering
- Test in incognito mode
- Check GA4 Real-time reports (events may take 24-48 hours in standard reports)

**Data discrepancies:**
- Internal traffic (your own visits) may inflate numbers
- Bot traffic can affect metrics
- Consider setting up filters in GA4

### Debug Mode
To enable debug mode, add this to your analytics.js:
```javascript
gtag('config', GA_MEASUREMENT_ID, {
  debug_mode: true  // Only for testing
});
```
